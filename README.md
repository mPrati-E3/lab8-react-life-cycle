In this repository, you can find two possible solutions of the [Lab 8](https://github.com/polito-WA1-2020/course-materials/blob/master/labs/L08-react-state-life-cycle.pdf):

* in the [master](https://github.com/polito-WA1-2020/lab8-react-life-cycle/tree/master) branch, a solution inspired from the exercise developed in class, with the "normal" version of Bootstrap
* in the [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/polito-WA1-2020/lab8-react-life-cycle/tree/react-bootstrap) branch, a solution made with `react-bootstrap`
